How to launch all the tests ?
=============================

You have to install the package
[orPyste](https://github.com/bc-python-tools/orpyste).
You can use ``pip`` to do that.


The scripts need also the very last working version of
[misTool](https://github.com/bc-python-tools/mistool)
*(strange but simpler for me and do not worry because the first tests are done on functionalities that we use to facilitate the writings of tests)*.
