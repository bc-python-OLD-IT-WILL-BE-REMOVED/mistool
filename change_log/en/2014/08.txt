**Some improvements !** Here's what to discover.

     1) In the module ``python_use``, the new function ``runpys`` lets you launch different Python files using certain criteria related to the paths of the scripts to run.

     2) In the modules ``os_use``, the functions ``listfile`` and ``nextfile``, and also the class ``DirView`` have a new boolean argument ``unkeephidden`` so as to skip the files and/or the hidden folders whose names usually begin with a period.

     3) In the module ``string_use``, to indicate several types of cases to the functions ``case`` and ``camelto``, it will be enough to simply separate these different formats using spaces.


**One bug fixed in the function ``about`` of the module ``latex_use``: ** an error was raised in the case of a non-standard installation of LaTeX (bug discovered under Lubuntu 14 with a TeX Live  distribution installed by hand). This type of installation is not supported at this time (but this is on the list of things to do).


**One pseudo bug fixed in the module ``os_use``: ** unlike what happens in Mac O$, under Lubuntu, folder paths returned by the standard function ``os.listdir`` do not appear in a logical order. This made impossible the practical use of the function `listdir`` and class` DirView`` (because it did not refer to standard output). This has been corrected.


**Fork misTool on GitHub:** the project is now managed via Git and hosted on the website GitHub.
