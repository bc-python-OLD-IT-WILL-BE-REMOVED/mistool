The project uses now some naming conventions. This implies the following major changes.

* ``latexUse`` becomes ``latex_use``.
* ``logTestUse`` becomes ``log_test_use``.
* ``osUse`` becomes ``os_use``.
* ``pythonUse`` becomes ``python_use``. In this module, the function ``pyrepr`` becomes ``pyRepr``.
* ``regexUse`` becomes ``regex_use``.
* ``stringUse`` becomes ``string_use``.
* ``urlUse`` becomes ``url_use``.

Some bugs have been fixed, and some important simplifications have been done in the interface.

In the module ``pythonUse``, the function ``name`` which tried to find the name of an object has been removing because unit tests have shown too much differences of the output between Unix like system and Windows. **The author will attempt to manage these failures.**
