The new functions ``nextDir`` and ``listDir`` return the paths of the directories contained in one directory.

The functions ``nextFile`` and ``listFile`` of the module ``os_use`` allow now to use criteria of researches regarding to the prefix of the name of the files (this feature is used by the function ``launchTestSuite`` of the module ``log_test_use``).

**Warning !** The variable ``sub`` of the functions ``nextFile`` and ``listFile``, and also of the class ``DirView`` has been deleted because it is not concretly usable without big problems.
